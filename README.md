# Ethanol Production Simulation
This project simulates ethanol production through glucose fermentation using MATLAB and differential equations. The focus is on modeling microbial kinetics and evaluating the effectiveness of the fermentation process.

### Objective
To analyze the production of ethanol through continuous fermentation, utilizing yeast to maximize yield and efficiency in a simulated reactor environment.

### Process
1) Model microbial kinetics using the Monod equation.
2) Implement Explicit Euler's method to solve the differential equations.
3) Plot the concentrations of glucose, yeast, and ethanol over time.
4) Compare simulation results with theoretical models.

### Results
1) Successfully simulated ethanol production, tracking concentration changes of glucose, yeast, and ethanol.
2) Visualized the fermentation process with accurate plotting of data.
3) Final concentrations: Glucose: **1.527741 g/L**, Yeast: **6.853750 g/L**, Ethanol: **49.236129 g/L**
